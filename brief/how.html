        <h2 class="font-semibold text-md"> CREATE/JOIN ROOM</h2>
       Simply write down the room name bellow to join or create the room and press " <i id="utilities-open" class="pointer shadow-lg  fas fa-search p-2   text-gray-800   bg-gray-300 rounded-full"></i> " button.
         
         Remember we do not list any room if you want to chat with your friend/friends you should share the room name with them.

    <h2 class="font-semibold text-md"> ENCRYPT/DECYRPT MESSAGES</h2>
    If you wish you can encode your messages in a crowded room via pressing 
        " <i id="utilities-open" class="pointer shadow-lg fas fa-passport text-gray-800  p-2 bg-gray-300 rounded-full"></i> " 
        then you can specify your password and start chatting even if you are in a crowded room.
         Whoever knows the password now can read your messages and write back to you.
          This simply protects your data. On a random occasion maybe someone can join your room and sneak your conversation.
           If you use the password protection it will work just fine.
